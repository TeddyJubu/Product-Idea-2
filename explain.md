## What I did just now (tests + setup)
## What I did (Implement idea deletion)

- Added a confirmation dialog to delete action in IdeaTable using shadcn Dialog
- On confirm, calls DELETE /api/ideas/[id]; the API already performs soft delete (sets deletedAt)
- On success, removes the row from the table and calls onIdeaDelete for parent refresh
- Why: Prevent accidental deletions and keep data recoverable via soft delete

Tests:
- Added tests/api-ideas-id.delete.test.ts → verifies soft delete sets deletedAt
- All tests passing

## What I did (Create idea detail page)

- Added route: /ideas/[id] at app/ideas/[id]/page.tsx
- Server-side auth + membership check, then loads idea with counts
- Renders Overview with metrics (Impact, Confidence, Effort, ICE) and simple tab anchors for Validation/Evidence/Comments placeholders
- Updated app/page.tsx: row clicks now navigate to /ideas/[id]
- Why: Provides a place to grow validation workflow while keeping navigation intuitive

Tests:
- Added tests/idea-table.view-details.test.tsx → clicking "View Details" in row menu calls onIdeaClick (used by navigation)
- All tests passing
## What I did (Validation tasks API + UI)

- API: Added /api/ideas/[id]/tasks (GET, POST) and /api/tasks/[taskId] (PATCH, DELETE) with membership checks
- UI: New IdeaTasksSection on idea detail: add tasks, toggle DONE, and see progress bar
- Why: Enables structured validation workflow and visible progress

Tests:
- Added API tests for list/create/update/delete
- Added component test to create a task and mark it DONE

## What I did (Evidence API + UI)

- API: Added /api/ideas/[id]/evidence (GET, POST) and /api/evidence/[evidenceId] (PATCH, DELETE)
- UI: New IdeaEvidenceSection to add and list evidence (title + URL)
- Why: Capture and display validation signals in one place

Tests:
- Added API tests for list/create/update/delete
- Added component test to add evidence and see it listed

## What I did (Validation workflow + transitions)

- Server: Enforced allowed status transitions in PATCH /api/ideas/[id]
  - PENDING → VALIDATING/ARCHIVED; VALIDATING → VALIDATED/ARCHIVED; VALIDATED → ARCHIVED
- Why: Ensures consistent lifecycle for ideas

Tests:
- Added tests to allow PENDING→VALIDATING and block PENDING→VALIDATED

## What I did (Confidence suggestions)

- API: Added /api/ideas/[id]/suggestions to compute suggestedConfidence from DONE tasks and evidence count
- Why: Gives a data-backed nudge to adjust confidence as validation progresses

Tests:
- Added test expecting confidence increase with tasks and evidence

## What I did (Progress indicators & checklist)

- UI: Checklist for tasks with toggles and a progress bar in IdeaTasksSection
- Why: Clear visual indicator of how far validation has progressed





As you asked, I installed test dependencies and added a minimal test setup. Then I wrote and ran tests for the idea editing feature. All tests are passing.

### 1) Installed dev dependencies (why and what)
- vitest – test runner (fast, modern)
- @testing-library/react – to test React components like a user would
- @testing-library/user-event – realistic user interactions (click, type)
- @testing-library/jest-dom – friendly DOM matchers like toBeInTheDocument
- jsdom – simulates a browser environment for component tests
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc – allows Vitest to compile our React/TSX during tests

Why: This stack is lightweight and standard for testing React in Next.js apps without adding a separate test runner like Jest.

### 2) Added config and scripts (where)
- vitest.config.ts – tells Vitest to use jsdom, load setup, and resolve our @/* imports.
- test/setup.ts – enables jest-dom matchers and polyfills ResizeObserver (used by Radix UI components like Slider) so tests don’t crash.
- package.json scripts:
  - test: "vitest run"
  - test:watch: "vitest"

### 3) Wrote tests (what they cover)
- tests/api-ideas-id.patch.test.ts
  - Mocks auth and DB.
  - Calls the PATCH handler for /api/ideas/[id] with a changed impact value.
  - Verifies iceScore is recalculated on the server and response is OK.
- tests/idea-edit-dialog.test.tsx
  - Renders IdeaEditDialog opened with a sample idea.
  - Mocks fetch and clicks "Update Idea".
  - Asserts a PATCH request is sent with correct fields and onSuccess is called.

### 4) Ran tests (result)
- Command: npm run test
- Result: All tests passed (2 passed).

### 5) Notes and gotchas (beginner explanations)
- Why polyfill ResizeObserver?
  - Some UI components (Radix Slider) expect browser APIs. jsdom doesn’t provide ResizeObserver, so we add a tiny no-op class during tests to keep components happy.
- Why both client and server tests?
  - Client test ensures the dialog sends the right request and responds correctly to success.
  - Server test ensures the source of truth (the API) recomputes ICE securely, not trusting the client.

### 6) Files added/changed in this step
- vitest.config.ts (new)
- test/setup.ts (new)
- tests/api-ideas-id.patch.test.ts (new)
- tests/idea-edit-dialog.test.tsx (new)
- package.json (scripts updated)

## Recap of the previous feature (Add idea editing)

- IdeaEditDialog uses PATCH and aligns with the API.
- API (/api/ideas/[id]) enforces authentication + workspace membership and recalculates ICE on updates.
- Build issues on the sign-in page were fixed (removed useSearchParams, added Suspense, dynamic = 'force-dynamic').

Why this matters for you:
- You can edit ideas safely and see updated ICE scores without trusting the browser.
- Only workspace members can change data.
- The app builds cleanly for CI/CD.

## How to run tests
- Run once: npm run test
- Watch mode: npm run test:watch

If anything fails, I’ll fix the tests or code and re-run until everything is green.
